# Class-Projects
I've been having fun with some of my class projects lately, and I'm a little disapointed that they will fade into my Google Drive, never to be seen again. So I'm uploading them to Github, in the hope that someone else is at least a fraction as amused as I was writing them!

## Intercultural Communication
This class, despite being apart of the speech department, was mostly writing, and it was more interesting than any English class I've ever taken. I saved the discussion posts that I made for one of our assignments.
