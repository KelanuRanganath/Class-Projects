# Independent Study program for Spring 2021

## Proposed Project

The calculus of variations provides a useful technique for analyzing a family of functions in a function space via functionals, I propose an abstraction to functionals, wherin functionals are denoted by a degree. A first degree functional operates on a normed linear function space, a second degree functional operates on a first degree functional space defined in a similar manner to a function space, ad infinitum...

The purpose of this study should be to formalize the notions of a normed linear space, variance, and composition in n-dimensional functional spaces.
