My location is Big Diomede Island; historically, it's inhabitants have been Russian, American, and the native Inupiat. Unfortunately, the Geert Hofstede value dimensions questionnaires used to build their interactive data set didn't have an option to delineate between citizens of a country and citizens of indigenous tribes [4]. Therefore, if I wanted to compare the Inupiat to the Yup'ik, the Sioux to the Iroquois, or the Luritja to the Bininj I would be out of luck since the closest I could get for each would be Canadian, American, or Australian, respectively.

With that in mind, I attempted to use datasets about the indigenous tribes of Eastern Alaska, collected by the Census Bureau [3], to answer the questionnaire. However, a significant portion of the questions is qualitative, and difficult to form a bijective correspondence to the census data, ie. "Are you a happy person?" Out of necessity, I will follow a purely qualitative approach to evaluating each value dimension -I apologize for the lack of fun looking bar graphs.

 

Power Dimension

Diplomat, pastor, and professor, John Ferch, goes into detail on the social structure of the Inupiat people in his ethnographic analysis, Secularization and Social Control in Alaskan Eskimo Culture: Shifting from Fear/Power to Honor/Shame [1]. His intent is to show the transition from a fear/power-based culture to an honor/shame-based culture, resulting from the secularization forces of the dominant western cultures. Fear/power based cultures, raise their children to work within the existing social hierarchies; whereas honor/shame cultures encourage their children to make a choice based on honor, as opposed to conformity [2].

Ferch elucidates this cultural morph by following the publications of Fred Savok, an Inupiat pastor who documented the culture of the Inupiats throughout much of the 1900s. Savok describes the fear that was used to enforce taboos and traditions during his early life, and throughout the life of his mother; according to Savok, "To an average Eskimo's life situation, fear permeated his whole life to the core."

Nancy Fogel-Chance published an article, Living in Both Worlds: "Modernity" and "Tradition" among North Slope Inupiaq Women in Anchorage, in the journal of Arctic Anthropology, that analyzed the cultural differences between Inupiaq women in Anchorage, a location with a heavy Euro-American influence, and women living in traditional environments in which they were still a part of the dominant culture [5]. Among many other factors, Chance looked at child-rearing practices. What she found was a striking arrogance on the part of Euro-American individuals for their culture; in some cases ordering foster care for Inupaiq children, due to a perceived sense of neglect.

This aggressive influence and ethnocide created children with behavioral traits that were contrary to traditional values, for example, "Many Inupiaq mothers were shocked to see their children refuse to share." These changes reflected a growing shift toward the honor-shame based system that is associated with the dominant Euro-American culture; supporting Savok's experience and Ferch's hypothesis.

Christian missionaries have been the primary group interested in completing cultural profiles on the Inupiat's. Robert Muller, was a Christian missionary experienced in communication with Arab cultures, this is why his system was favored, which is where the power-fear and honor/shame cultural identity titles are taken from [6]. It's clear that there has been a transition from a power-fear based culture to an honor-shame based culture. The question is now: what is the correlation between Geert Hofstede's power dimension and Roland Muller's three-color world view system. Unfortunately, while there is a great deal of research of the efficacy of each system, there is little understanding of how they are interrelated.

Beowulf, an old-English poem written during the Anglo-Saxon rule of England, can serve as one way to connect the two value systems. Firstly, noting that the Anglo-Saxon culture has a lower power distance [11]. Secondly, according to A Beowulf Handbook [10], the poem expresses a shame-based culture, "The poem's last word, echoing its first universalizing comment on what constitutes the good, confronts us with an ethical system that, though not completely alien to us is not our own. Beowulf, like the Chanson de Roland, assumes and expresses the values of a 'shame culture,'". The fact that both the Inupiat and Anglo-Saxon culture are honor-shame based and the Anglo-Saxons have a low PDI, doesn't imply on its own that the Inupiats have a similar PDI. However, when looking at a hierarchical system like education there are many similarities between the Anglo-Saxons and the Inupiats. Both in Nancy Fogel's article, and “Can you please stop talking while I teach?” –Anglo-Saxon teaching expectations in a French business education environment[11] there exists a deviation from the standard student-teacher dynamic for both the Inupiats and Anglo-Saxons, respectively. In both cases, there's a rejection of the system that Paulo Friere would describe as a banking concept of education, in which the teacher acts as an ultimate authority teaching a passive object, for a more horizontal learning structure. This similarity in education, a system that is highly indicative of a cultures larger behavior with respect to authority, suggests that the power distance of the Inupiats and the Anglo-Saxons are closely related. Therefore, we can use the Anglo-Saxon culture, which has been studied more extensively, as a cultural surrogate for the Inupiats, at least for power distance.

When looking at the United States, there is a relatively low power distance, even when compared to France -the closest data to Anglo-Saxons [12]. This suggests that the power distance of the Inupiat culture is slightly higher than that of America; there is clearly some difference since Fogel documented that there was difficulty assimilating into the hierarchical structure for Inupiat students. However, it's a lot closer than what I had originally assumed it would be.

 

Individualism

Like most indigenous cultures the Inupiats are group oriented. Chance's work shows how this collectivist culture, especially with respect to mothering is viewed by a highly individualistic society like the Euro-American one that is dominant in Anchorage Alaska. Children are respected with autonomy, and are free to move about as they please -even relocating to other residences- before a set age of maturity; while this may seem to be indicative of a more individualistic culture, the reason for the autonomy is because there is a shared sense of responsibility with their culture to take care of the child, a collectivist stance to mothering.

The standard Euro-American individual-oriented culture is at odds with the many group-oriented cultures [9]. The Euro-American dominant culture is highly ethnocentric, forces assimilation, and individualism. The effects of this juxtaposition between the American culture and the Inupiats is saddening; this causes strain on traditional collectivist Inupiat family structures, leading to higher than average levels of suicide and depression [7].

With that being said there's a distinction between individualism and personal liberty, two values that are often conflated. While there is a stark contrast between how each culture views its responsibility to the group, there is a similarity in the value placed on personal liberty, if not more so in the Inupiat culture. However, Hofstede's individualism value dimension refers not to the value placed on personal liberty, but the degree to which a culture is group-oriented. Therefore we can conclude that while there are some similarities that are closely related to individualism, the individualism dimensions are contrasting, with the Inupiat value much lower than that of the United States.

 

Masculinity

The Inupiat dialect, Inuktitut, like English, is gender-neutral, however certain nouns are gendered. Additionally, cultural anthropologists have observed that jobs within the Inupiat culture are split along gender. This has led some, erroneously, to conclude that there is a preference for male traits and gender; since a male bias has been observed in other cultures that split work between genders. However, according to Dr. Barbra Bodenhorn's research paper on the masculinity of the Inupiat culture, I'm Not the Great Hunter, My Wife Is [8], while it's true that certain tasks are often delegated to a certain gender, there's no bias or hesitation to letting a woman perform a job typically given to men or vice versa; not only does there seem to be little bias, but rather an expectation that each gender is capable of completing the tasks associated with other genders.

In the Inupiat culture, both masculine and feminine traits are valued, suggesting that they have a neutral masculinity value dimension. On the other hand, America has a score of 62, which would suggest that American culture values masculine traits more than the Inupiat culture.

 

Uncertainty Avoidance

The Inupiat culture is one of resilience, even in the face of uncertainty. The Inupiat's have adapted countless times: when mammoths, their primary source of food at one point, became extinct; when western influences appeared in the 1800s; and currently with climate change affecting the North Slope at twice the rate of the rest of the continental united states. Being forced to adapt has seemed to make the Inupiats almost indifferent to change, a sentiment that can be felt in Kaare Erikson, a native Inupiat's, comment on climate change, "We’ve always been able to adapt and be resilient. This is no different." [13]

Hofestede's uncertainty avoidance value dimension asks not how well a culture adapts to change, but how averse they are to the prospect of an unknown future. The general indifference, a result of centuries of conditioning, seems to suggest that the Inupiats have a low uncertainty avoidance. First-hand research, conducted by Chie Sakakibara in 'Our Home is Drowning': Inupiat Storytelling and Climate Change in Point Hope, Alaska, suggests that there is an acceptance around uncertain futures, because of the important role that storytelling plays in the Inupiat culture. Storytelling serves as a way to rationalize sudden changes, and lower uncertainty avoidance. For example: after Old Town became submerged in the Bearing Sea, and the residents relocated to New Town -the changing coastline is pictured below- the residents found strange sinkholes on the shore, there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what they were. But they were rationalized through local storytelling and folklore as the work of Little People, imp-like creatures that play pranks on humans. My conclusion is consistent with that of Sakakibara, "My study suggests that contemporary storytelling among the Inupiat of Point Hope seeks to cope with an unpredictable future. [18]"

The Inuktitut dialect reflects the low uncertainty avoidance, by reflecting an acceptance of an unknown future. According to Edna McLean, an Inupiat linguist in her paper, Culture and Change for Ieupiat and Yupik of Alaska, "The concept of interdependence stands out in the structure of the Ieupiaq and Yupik languages. Each word has a marker which identifies its relation to the other words in the sentence. There is no set order of words in a sentence just as there is no way of determining what will happen next in nature. Man cannot control nature." [14]. This is a language feature that is also present in Finnish.

While it's clear that the Inupiat have a low uncertainty avoidance, the question is how it's related to the United States, which also has a relatively low uncertainty avoidance. In comparison to Finland, which has a similar emphasis on the importance of storytelling and similar linguistic features that are indicative of a culture's uncertainty avoidance, Finland has a lower score. This suggests that the Inupiat culture has a score that is lower than the United States.

Long Term Orientation

Hofstede's long-term orientation assesses to what degree a culture resists change [19]. This definition is very similar to uncertainty avoidance. However, there is still an average deviation of about 58 percent in the percent differences between the UA and LTO dimensions -using data scraped from Hofstede's website-, so our low UA doesn't necessarily imply a low LTO. The standard deviation and the graph tell different stories, one suggests that our data is very spread out, the other suggests that there's a much higher density at deviations below 10%. I'm more inclined to trust the standard deviation measurement and conclude that while there are similarities between the two scores in many instances, we can't make any assumptions about the LTO based on the UA.

Instead, we can look at the Inupiat Ilitqusiat, a set of tenets important to the Inupiat culture, which reinforces the importance of core principles and values like humor, hard work, and responsibility to the tribe. Inupiat Ilitqusiat, was codified by the Northwest Alaska Native Association and exists to improve the quality of life of its community [15, 17]. These values provide valuable insight in finding both the long term orientation and indulgence of the Inupiats.

While the Inupiat culture has evolved over the years, there is a resistance to assimilation, and a desire to maintain cultural values as much as possible. Steven McNabb, Culture Goals in Northwest Alaska, surveyed several village elders to document the local Ilitquasit variations. There were several common trends, one of the more relevant ones is in regards to native food, "This theme is entirely consistent with strong values that promote Native food [15]."

Another elder raised the concern that younger generations weren't participating in subsistence practices, claiming that "Subsistence is the number one issue by far." The solution presented by the community wasn't to move on from subsistence living but to reinforce subsistence education. These values are indicative of a low long term orientation. The United States is similar in this respect, and are likely nearly equivalent.

 

Indulgence

Hofstede's indulgence value (IR) is defined as a spectrum between indulgence and restraint, with each being defined, respectively, "Indulgence stands for a society that allows relatively free gratification of basic and natural human drives related to enjoying life and having fun. Restraint stands for a society that suppresses gratification of needs and regulates it by means of strict social norms [19]." Hedonism, defined as "the doctrine that pleasure or happiness is the sole or chief good in life [20]" accurately describes the values of a purely indulgence-oriented culture. Therefore, it's reasonable to describe Hofstede's indulgence dimension as a numerical representation of hedonism, where a high IR implies a hedonistic culture and vice versa.

Some authors have suggested that the Inupiat culture is at odds with hedonism. Jon Reynher, author of Revitalizing Indegenous Languages, discovered a card with the Inupiat Ilitqusiat, and wrote the following in his analysis "I have kept this card in my wallet as a reminder that indigenous language revitalization is part of a larger attempt by indigenous peoples to retain their cultural strengths in the face of the demoralizing assaults of an all-pervasive modern individualistic, materialistic, and hedonistic technological culture [22]."

Several philosophers have claimed that subsistence living, and being in close contact with nature is mutually exclusive to hedonism, "In well-known ideas of wilderness, expressed, for example by Henry David Thoreau, John Muir, or Aldo Leopold, the notion of living a simple life in close contact with Mother Nature stands in sharp contrast to the almost thoughtless hedonism dominating the materialistic ideologies of modern societies [21]."

These conclusions are supported by the first-hand account of Inupiat elder Patricia Cochran, "I was raised in a traditional way and regard it as my job to be a steward of the land. I see this [industrialised] world of hedonism and consumption as a sign we have lost our moral compass [23]." Based on this account, a more current observation: the Inupiat culture was at one point more restraint-oriented, but through hedonistic Euro-American influences, has since transitioned to a more indulgence-oriented culture.

However, culture is dynamic, since a large portion of the Inupiat is subsistence hunters [24], the lifestyle of individuals can vary by season. During seasons with sparse resources and game, there is a higher likelihood for domestic abuse, whereas during seasons with abundant resources infidelity rates increase and hedonistic behaviors are more prevalent [25]. The Inupiat perception of infidelity has changed over time. Before the Christian missionaries imposed monogamous values on marriage in the 1800s the Inupiat view on marriage allowed for individuals to sleep with others in certain circumstances [27]. This variation in the meaning of infidelity and it's frequency suggests that the Inupiat culture has transitioned from an indulgence oriented culture into a restraint culture; which is contradictory to our previous conclusion.

The solution to this contradiction is to observe that the Inupiat culture has seen an increase in the frequency of activities that are considered indulgent, more because of a shift in what it means to be indulgent as opposed to an actual increase of indulgent activities. Furthermore, Hofstede's IR dimension only asks how accepting culture is of hedonistic activities, not it's occurrence. By modern standards the Inupiat culture has an IR score that is higher than if we were to use a traditional lens.

If there are different ways that we can view a culture, who says that one lens is more accurate than another? Why should the modern Euro-American view of hedonism supersede the traditional Inupiat definition? Hofstede's system is inherently universalist, which is clear in situations like this that can only be analyzed from a relativist perspective. Hofstede's questions are standardized, which is meant to create a baseline, but what do you do when a culture's values osculate, or can give different answers when looked at through different lenses; an Inupiat elder will likely give an answer from a traditional perspective resulting in an IR higher than the U.S., whereas an individual from a younger generation will give an answer based on a Euro-American influenced lens, which may be similar or even less than the U.S..

Universalist studies like Hofstede's value dimensions, no matter how many disclaimers are on his website, reinforce an ethnocentric and static approach to ethnographic studies. Academics have seemed to leave out this flaw, our textbook introduces the concept with an odd absolutism, "Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede and his associates have identified several additional cultural values that help us understand cultural differences [28]." Throughout this discussion post I hope you've realized that there are a lot of assumptions made about the Inupiat culture based on universalist perspectives, like Hofstede's, which have lowered the quality of life of the individuals and are what have necessitated the Inupiat Ilitqusiat.

Thank you for reading my dissertation.

 

TL;DR

I at one point wanted to move to Alaska, but I'm now sick of hearing about anything related to Alaska, snow, or people. This discussion post was much harder than I thought it would be, and yet I barely scratched the surface.

p.s. I found out that there is a video game meant to pass on the Inupiat oral history to younger generations. It's pretty cool, but I could never really figure out what dimension I could include that tidbit in [16].
